Server Configuration (server.js)
Entry Point: Main application setup and configuration

Key Components:
Express Setup:
CORS configured for frontend (localhost:3000)
Body parsing middleware (JSON and URL-encoded)
Error handling middleware

Notable Features:
Email Transporter: Nodemailer configured with SMTP settings from environment variables

API Routes:
/api/auth - Authentication endpoints
/api/contests - Contest-related endpoints
/api/platform - Coding platform management
/api/profile - User profile management
/api/platforms/update - Platform update specific endpoints

Email Reminder Endpoint:

Sends contest reminders with details (contest name, platform, start time, URL)
Validates required fields before sending

Security:
Credentials allowed in CORS
Auth token exposed in headers
Environment variables for sensitive data

Database Models
1. User Model (models/User.js)
Schema Fields:

Basic info: name, email (unique), password
Profile: profilePicture, bio, social links (githubUrl, linkedinUrl, portfolioUrl)
Stats: contestsParticipated
Preferences: notificationPreferences (email/browser)
Relationships: platforms array (references Platform model)

Features:

Timestamps for creation/updates
Password excluded from queries by default


2. Platform Model (models/Platform.js)
Schema Fields:

Relationship: user (reference to User)
Platform info: platformName (enum), handle
Stats: rating, maxRating, rank, solvedProblems
Problem breakdown: problemBreakdown (easy/medium/hard counts)
History: updateHistory array tracking changes over time



Advanced Features:
Compound unique index: Ensures one handle per platform per user
Virtual field: platformUrl automatically generates profile URL
Pre-save hook: Sets profileUrl if not provided
Indexes for ranking/leaderboard queries


Authentication System (routes/auth.js)
Key Components:
OTP Verification:
Generates 6-digit OTP
Stores temporarily (in-memory, with 10min expiry)
Sends via email with HTML template


Registration:
Requires OTP verification
Password requirements: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
Bcrypt hashing (12 rounds)
JWT token generation (7-day expiry)

Login:
Email/password authentication
Bcrypt comparison
Returns JWT token


Protected Routes:

authMiddleware verifies JWT
/me endpoint for current user data


Security Features:
Token expiration handling
Error handling for invalid/expired tokens
Password never returned in responses


Routes
1. Auth Routes (routes/auth.js)
Covered in Authentication System section

2. Contest Routes (routes/contests.js)
   Key Features (from code):

           Fetches contests from coding platforms
           Processing logic for Codeforces contests
           Filtering by contest phase
   
3. Platform Routes (routes/platform.js)
Expected Functionality:
CRUD operations for user's coding platforms
Handle verification
Profile data fetching

4. Profile Routes (routes/profile.js)
Expected Functionality:
Update user profile info
Manage social links
Notification preferences

5. Platform Update Routes (routes/platformUpdate.js)
Specialized Purpose:
Handles periodic updates of platform stats
Likely interacts with scraping services




Validation Utilities
Validation Middlewares:
Profile Update:
Name: 2-50 chars
Bio: <500 chars
URL validation for social links
Platform-specific handle validation



Platform Operations:
Validates platformName against enum
Handle format checks per platform
Unique handle enforcement


Ownership verification

Helper Functions:
isValidUrl: Proper URL validation
validateHandle: Platform-specific regex checks
Error formatting for consistent API responses


Email Service
Implementations:
Reminder Emails (server.js):
Customizable HTML templates

Error handling

OTP Emails (auth.js):
Styled HTML templates
Expiration notices


Security warnings
Configuration:
SMTP settings from environment variables

Receives JWT token

Platform Setup:

Authenticated request to /api/platform

Handle validated per platform rules

Data stored with user association

Contest Interaction:

Fetch contests ‚Üí /api/contests
